Due to licensing restrictions, the source files for the VST SDK are not included in this distribution but must be obtained from Steinberg and copied to this folder manually. Simply put the entire installation beneath this subdirectory. The final directory should looks something like this:

beos/
doc/
mac/
ReadMeAboutVSTSDK.txt (this file)
resource/
sgi/
source/ (actually, the only required directory)
VST Licensing Agreement.html
VST Licensing Agreement.rtf
win/
